            <p>After studying biochemistry at Duke University, I embarked on an unusual journey of becoming a professional poker
                player. From 2008 to 2017 I acheived success in this field, becoming a lead instructor at the world renowned
                training site "Cardrunners.com" and also becoming a pro for "Full-Tilt". During that time, I also successfully
                started and co-owned a bar/restaurant in Cambridge, MA called "Lord Hobo", invested in several pieces of
                real estate, and co-created the smartphone app "Blitzpick" that allows Daily Fantasy Sports players to automatically
                optimize lineups.
            </p>
            <p> Recently, however, with the birth of my second child and my first child reaching an impressionable age, I decided
                that the stress, unpredictability, and instability of being a professional poker player was too difficult
                to balance with family life, and decided to retire. Our family of four moved from Las Vegas to Calabasas,
                CA, where we currently reside. I enjoy challenging myself, and as such, couldn't tolerate the slow pace of retirement.
                Soon, I was able to discover my passion in programming and web development. I am currently enrolled in
                the UCLA Full Stack program, and hope to become a competent Junior Developer upon graduation. </p>
